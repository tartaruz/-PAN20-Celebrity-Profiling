The code is written in Python 3.8.5 and will therefore need at least Python3 and upward to function. Additionally, the codebase has a part where file manipulation is performed and could need some form of permissions to operate. The system was created in a Linux( Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS) environment and has not been tested on Windows nor Mac systems.
